# Fetch 
### An app to help you fetch the things you've lost.

The concept for this app was to put low-energy bluetooth beacons with cameras on them in drawers.
Whenever the drawer was opened or closed we would record changes in the items in the drawer.

Over time, you would create an inventory system for your home.
You can then use our app to guide you to the object you've lost by determining your distance from the BLE device in the drawer and playing a game of hot-and-cold.

This was the product, and it actually works (but only for a FitBit Flex BLE module). You can change this in the bluetooth search view controller.
